关于Person的类型（representation）::
Yes, it can be a string (though you should think carefully about whether that's a good representation).  
But it doesn't have to be string.  Without defining a parsePerson function, it would have to be a string.


Assume culprits and lineup are always two people?
 
We won't give any test cases with invalid inputs, so from the standpoint of 
ng tests, you don't need to test these things.  But from the standpoint of 
code quality, you should ensure inputs are valid.
